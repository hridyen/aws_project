# CSV Data Visualization using AWS S3 & QuickSight

This project demonstrates how to visualize structured CSV data using AWS services — specifically 'Amazon S3' and 'Amazon QuickSight'— by leveraging a'JSON manifest file'for integration.

---

## Tech Stack
- **AWS S3** – for CSV file storage
- **AWS QuickSight** – for data analysis and visualization
- **JSON Manifest** – for S3 to QuickSight connection

---

##  What I Did
- Uploaded a sample `Amazon-Bestseller-Dataset.csv` file to **Amazon S3** bucket.
- Created a 'JSON manifest file' to define the location and format of the dataset.
- Used 'AWS QuickSight' to read the manifest and import the data.
- Built visual dashboards and charts in QuickSight using the dataset.
- Took screenshots of the working setup to preserve the project.
